 Both await and promises are used to handle the operation asynchronously but the most 
 secure method is promises because in that there are three states such as pending,resolve and rejected 
 and  if the task is not completed yet then it will go to pending , if the task is completed then it will go 
 to the resolve and if the task is rejected then it goes to rejected . by these three method in promises we can easily 
 run the code asynchronously . In promises we can handle the error by using then and catch method but when we use asynchronous
  operation then we used async and await functionality and for handling the error we use try and catch method. 
 In await functionality it helps to remove the complexity of the code which try to block the code and run the code synchronously.
