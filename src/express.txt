ExpressJs build in midddleware method
1 app.use(express.json()) 
used for parsing incoming requests with JSON payload
making that data available in the req.body or further processing within the routes
parse in to json based on BODY-PARSER (Ye HTTP request ke body ko parse karta hai — especially POST, PUT, aur PATCH requests mein.)

2 app.use(express.raw())
It parses incoming request payloads into a Buffer and is based on body-parser
It returns an Object

When would you use it?
When you're receiving binary data (e.g., images, audio, custom file formats)
When you don’t want Express to parse the body as JSON or string — you want full control
Often used in webhooks (e.g., Stripe webhooks), where you need the exact raw body to verify a signature

3 app.use(express.static(root='PUBLIC', [options))
const options = {
  dotfiles: 'ignore',
  etag: false,
  extensions: ['htm', 'html'],
  index: false,
  maxAge: '1d',
  redirect: false,
  setHeaders (res, path, stat) {
    res.set('x-timestamp', Date.now())
  }
}

app.use(express.static('public', options))
allows you to serve static files based on  sarve-static(like images, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) directly to the client
Create a new middleware function to serve files from within a given root directory. 
The file to serve will be determined by combining req.
url with the provided root directory. When a file is not found, instead of sending a 404 response, 
this module will instead call next() to move on to the next middleware, allowing for stacking and fall-backs.


4 express.urlencoded([options])
used to parse URL-encoded form data, making it accessible as a JavaScript object in req.body.

express.urlencoded()	- Form se aaya data read karne ke liye
extended: true		- Thoda complex data (array, object) bhi handle karta hai
req.body		- Form ka pura data yahan milta hai

5 express.Router()
